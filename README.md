Introduction and Purpose:
This repo was created to determine how _Sarracenia_ characteristics predict biomass using the _Sarracenia_ physiology dataset that can be found [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-hfr.109.18). All of this data is publicly available and can also be searched for using the following citation: Ellison, A. and E. Farnsworth. 2021. Effects of Prey Availability on Sarracenia Physiology at Harvard Forest 2005 ver 18. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/26b22d09279e62fd729ffc35f9ef0174 (Accessed 2023-05-29). 

Methodology:
This dataset examined the impact of prey availability on photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, architecture, and foliar nutrient/chlorophyll content of 10 pitcher plant (Sarracenia) species. To conduct this experiment, two plants of each Sarracenia species were assigned to one of six feeding levels ranging from 0 - 0.25g of finely ground wasps per feeding (for small species), 0 - 0.5g (for intermediate sized species), and 0 - 1.0g (for large species). The plants were fed once a week for a total of 7 weeks. In addition, aboveground size and photosynthetic rate were measured before treatments started.
